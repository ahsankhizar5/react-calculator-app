# Yo, Check Out My React Calculator App! 🧮

Hey there! This is my solution for a peer-reviewed assignment in my React course. It’s a slick calculator app built with React that handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Ready to crunch some numbers? Let’s roll!

## What’s This Thing Do? 🤔

- Displays a clean calculator interface with a display screen and buttons.
- Handles basic math: addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (×), and division (÷).
- Includes a clear button (C) to reset everything.
- Shows “Error” if you try to divide by zero (no crashing here!).
- Responsive grid layout for buttons, styled with CSS.
- Built with React for dynamic state management and smooth interactions.

   ```

5. Open Chrome, hit `http://localhost:3000`, and:
   - Click numbers (0–9) to build your input.
   - Hit an operator (+, −, ×, ÷) to set up the calculation.
   - Press `=` to get the result.
   - Use `C` to start fresh.
   - Try something like `5 × 3 =` and watch the magic!

## What’s Inside? 📂

Just the essentials:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file in `public/`.
- `src/App.js`: The React component with all the calculator logic.
- `src/App.css`: Custom styles for the calculator’s look.
- `package.json`: Dependencies and scripts.
- `.gitignore`: Keeps `node_modules` and junk out.
- `README.md`: This awesome guide you’re reading!

## Tools I Used 🛠️

- **React**: For building the interactive UI.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Powers the math and state logic.
- **CSS3**: Styles the buttons and display with a clean grid.
- **Create React App**: Sets up the project with zero hassle.
- **Node.js/NPM**: Manages dependencies and runs the app.
